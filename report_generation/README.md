## Generate HTML and excel reports from BAI metrics from cloudwatch

*This is a WIP*


To generate a report, export the credentials in your environment and run the script.

It's recommended to create a virtualenv and install requirements.txt with pip to set up
dependencies.

For development, data is saved as pickled files so when developing the script there's not need to
constantly pull data from the network.
